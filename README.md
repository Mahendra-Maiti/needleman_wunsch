# Needleman Wunsch Sequence alignment #

Implementation of Needleman-Wunsch sequence alignment algorithm


## Running from terminal ##

` python3 needleman_wunsch.py -q query_sequence_file -r reference_sequence_file `

The query sequence is human protein sequence, and the reference sequence is the fly protein sequence. Thus, for alignment of HOX protein the following command should be given:

` python3 needleman_wunsch.py -q Human_HOX.fa -r Fly_HOX.fa `
