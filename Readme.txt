In order to run the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm the following command line instruction is required:

python3 needleman_wunsch.py -q Human_PAX.fa -r Fly_PAX.fa 


The query sequence is human protein sequence, and the reference sequence is the fly protein sequence. Thus, for alignment of HOX protein the following command should be given:

python3 needleman_wunsch.py -q Human_HOX.fa -r Fly_HOX.fa
